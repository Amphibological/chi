# Elgin
A low-level systems programming language with a few fun things using LLVM as a backend.

Elgin is currently very work-in-progress, and not useable for anything, but hopefully that will change sometime in the future.

Feel free to browse the code, or check out the WIP documentation [here](https://github.com/Amphibological/elgin/wiki).
